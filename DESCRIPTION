Description: It is an all-in-one import/export function, capable of importing 
CSV, XLS, XLSX, DTA, SAS7BDAT files and, exporting CSV, XLS, XLSX files.
All thanks to "xlsx" package authors for a significant improvement in exporting 
excel files over Java environment with "rJava".

    readwrite(filepath, writepath, sheet = 1, skip = 0, read = TRUE, write = FALSE)
    
For "read = TRUE" & "write = FALSE", "filepath" is the path of the file to be imported.
For "write = TRUE" & "read = FALSE", "filepath" is the file that is to be exported,
and "writepath" is the path where it is to be exported. And, sheet value should be in double quotes.
E.g. readwrite(file, "C:/Users/Personal/Documents/file.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1", read = FALSE, write = TRUE)
